### Intention
The purpose of this space is to document experiments and experiences. I hope to better remember and reinforce what I learn through these records. If others happen to learn something through my musings, that is even better.

I am not entirely sure what to include here yet, so for now this is my placeholder.

-Bio-

31yr old lifelong computer geek. I know a little about a lot of things, my goal is to know a lot about a particular few, enough to make myself marketable. Currenly dove head first into linux after being a windows guy. Over the past 2 years I have become quite proficient with macOS, but as my current mbp is out of date and un-upgradable, I figured it would be fun to turn it into a linux machine, since a lot of what I learned in macOS is transferable.

I am happy to talk to anyone, or collaborate on most anything. Just looking to socialize really - one of my areas of weakness!

Anyways, if you happened to accidentally end up here and actually read to this point, thank you for visiting! :D
